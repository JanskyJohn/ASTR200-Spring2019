    "The first two lines should look familiar: they just create two arrays, x and y, that go from -2 pi to 2 pi with a spacing of 0.01. The third line invokes a function you probably haven't seen before, called meshgrid, which is part of the numpy library. The meshgrid function does something very useful. In this case we've passed it two one-dimensional arrays, representing x and y coordinates. We can think of these two arrays as defining a 2D grid of points, with formed by combining all the possible x values with all the possible y values. The meshgrid function gives us back a pair of two-dimensional arrays, xx and yy, that represent the x and y coordinates of these mesh points. Specifically, xx[0,:] = x[0], xx[1,:] = x[1], xx[2,:] = x[2], ..., and similarly yy[:,0] = y[0], yy[:,1] = y[1], yy[:,2] = y[2], and so forth. The keyword indexing='ij' specifies that the x coordinate goes with the first dimension of the output arrays, and the y coordinate with the second. Finally, note that, though we've used it in 2D, the meshgrid command will work for an arbitrary number of dimensions.\n",

This function lets us grab the axes we're currently plotting to -- something that will become important when we get to multiple axes in a few minutes.

This can be either a single number, which just specifies how many contours to use, or an array giving the exact values to use for the contours. For example, for our sinc function we know that the maximum is 2.0, and the minimum is -0.43 (you can show this analytically, or just check by doing amax(z1) and amin(z1)), so we can choose contours to go from -0.4 to 1.0 in a spacing of 0.1."

First, imshow is often used as a way of displaying images, in which case there aren't really x and y coordinates, just pixels values. Second, for contour, you are allowed to have x and y points that aren't evenly spaced, whereas for imshow() you aren't. Thus you don't need to specify every x and y point, just the minimum and maximum.\n",

When displaying images, the normal convention is that pixel (0,0) is in the top left corner, (0,1) is right below it, (0,2) is right below that, etc. This is the default for imshow(). To display things as we normally plot data, where (0,0) is the origin, (0,1) is above it, etc., we specify origin='lower', which says to place the origin in the lower left rather than upper left corner.\n",
